# RS021-sudoku-solver

The application solves sudoku which is given as an image in .bmp format.

The project consists of the following parts:

- GUI which takes sudoku image and shows the solution or notification that solution does not exist
- Part which turns image to black-white image in order to relieve number recognition (_function readImage_)
- Part for sudoku table and number recognization which writes appropriate numbers to appropriate fields
- Part for solving sudoku (_sudoku.cpp_)
    

The algorithm for Ojler's number was taken from [[link]](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/64d9/63ee2e3b47b135cd39cf576069f034b0d4d5.pdf).
